### Business Operations

**Predictable Performance**: As your business grows, you can predict exactly how Monetra will perform. Double your transaction volume, double the processing time - no surprises.

**Future-Proof**: Built to handle the demands of modern financial applications, from mobile apps to high-frequency trading systems.

### Getting the Best Performance

**For E-commerce and Retail:**

- Work with cents when possible (like payment processors do) for maximum speed
- Use simple addition and subtraction for cart totals before applying complex tax calculations
- Process orders in batches during high-traffic periods
- Initialize new customer accounts with zero balances for fastest setup

**For Large-Scale Operations:**

- Handle transactions in groups of 1,000 rather than processing millions individually
- Generate audit reports during off-peak hours when possible
- Consider the trade-off between complex profit-sharing formulas and processing speed

**For Real-Time Applications:**
